## üëã Introduction

[README Fish](#) dynamicly generates a blazingly fast static HTML version of any public GitHub repos README.md file and caches it on a CDN using CloudFlare Workers. Simply go the [homepage](https://readme.fish) and specify the GitHub repo as the path, similar to how a repo is accessed on GitHub e.g. `readme.fish/username/repo`. Try [this](https://readme.fish/betahuhn/readme-fish) repo as an example!

## üìö Usage

[README Fish](#) generates a static HTML version of any public GitHub repo and caches it in a fast CDN. This might be useful for a variety of usecases. Maybe you want to quickly view a repos README without the clutter of the GitHub UI. Or you want a fast hosted version of your repos README file/documentation. You could even use it to host your own [mini website](https://readme.fish/betahuhn/betahuhn)!

## üíª Available commands

- run `yarn lint` or `npm run lint` to run eslint.
- run `yarn test` or `npm run test` to run all Mocha tests.
- run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to run the Worker locally with [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/commands#dev).
- run `yarn build` or `npm run build` to produce a production version with webpack.
